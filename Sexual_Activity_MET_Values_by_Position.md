| | FF | 6.0-7.0 | 3.0-4.0 | Extrapolated: ~10% more, both female |

## Important Notes

### Data Limitations
- **MF (male-female) values:** Based on peer-reviewed research studies
- **MM and FF values:** Extrapolated estimates based on physiological principles
- Most research studies involved male-female (MF) heterosexual couples aged 18-35
- No peer-reviewed studies found specifically measuring MM or FF configurations
- Extrapolations assume similar biomechanics with adjustments for average male vs. female energy expenditure patterns

### Extrapolation Methodology for MM and FF
The MM and FF values were extrapolated using these principles:
1. **Base metabolism:** Men average ~6.0 METs, women ~5.6 METs during sexual activity (from research)
2. **Role-based adjustment:** Active/top partner expends more energy than passive/bottom partner (consistent across all configurations)
3. **MM extrapolation:** Used male baseline values; may trend slightly higher for both partners due to typically greater muscle mass and average body weight
4. **FF extrapolation:** Used female baseline values; similar activity patterns expected with slightly lower absolute energy expenditure
5. **Position effects:** Applied same relative increases/decreases across all configurations (e.g., standing +10%, top vs. bottom differential)

### Key Findings from Research
1. Men average 6.0 METs and women average 5.6 METs during sexual activity
2. The man-on-top position shows higher energy expenditure than woman-on-top for the active partner
3. General sexual activity ranges from 1.3 METs for passive/light effort to 2.8 METs for moderate activity
4. Being on top burns more calories than being on bottom, and standing positions may burn approximately 10% more than lying positions

### For Reference
- **Low intensity:** < 3 METs (equivalent to slow walking)
- **Moderate intensity:** 3-6 METs (equivalent to brisk walking)
- **Vigorous intensity:** > 6 METs (equivalent to jogging)

### Average Session Data
- Average sexual session: ~24 minutes, burning 101 kcal (men) or 69 kcal (women)
- Individual variation is high based on duration, intensity, position changes, and fitness level
